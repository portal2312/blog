Troubleshooting — Server Stuck at Boot Phase
Depending on how your server has been set up, when the machine starts up it may remain in the boot phase showing a message like this:

Initial setup of CentOS Linux 7 (core)
1) [!] License information (Licence not accepted)
Please make your choice from above ['q' to quit | 'c' to continue | 'r' to refresh]:
To get past this, press 1 (license read), then 2 (accept licence), and then C (to continue). You may have to press C two or more times. The image below shows this:

If you don't see this error and the boot process is smooth, all the better – you can move on to the next step.
